i am assuming you react developer and you how to use node 
the explations are in case you forgote the process 

for server part 
do this on terminal on node installed computer or you can use bun (-- for the server bun is werid on bcrypt use node or nodemon 


cd seerver  on terminal 
npm i (or bun i) on terminal 
go to google credental create o auth 2.0 
and save your clint id and client secret on .env file 
nodemon index.js (do this on the terminal )
if you dont have nodemon use node 

cd ../client
npm i (or bun i)
type "node run dev"
it should open a server on the location seen on the termial 
if you got an error google that (i forgot you already know that )
